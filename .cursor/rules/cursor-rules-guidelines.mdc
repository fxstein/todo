When creating Cursor rules for todo.ai, keep them **short, precise, and highly specific**.

**Requirements:**
- Rules must be concise and actionable
- Include only essential information
- Avoid verbose explanations or lengthy examples
- Focus on what agents MUST do or MUST NOT do
- Remove unnecessary detail that can be found in documentation

**Pattern:**
- Start with critical requirements if applicable
- Use clear ✅/❌ examples for correct vs incorrect behavior
- Reference documentation instead of duplicating content
- Keep rule files under ~30 lines when possible

**Review before committing:**
- Can this rule be shorter?
- Is every line essential?
- Can examples/references be condensed or moved to docs?

**NEVER** create verbose, extensive rules with lengthy checklists or detailed explanations - keep them focused and scannable.
