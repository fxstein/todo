This release introduces a powerful migration and cleanup system that automatically fixes issues in existing installations when users update. The migration system addresses a critical gap where fixes implemented in new code don't automatically apply to existing installations - for example, the section order fix implemented in task #19 only affected new section creation, not existing files with incorrect ordering.

The migration system enables developers to create one-time migrations that run automatically based on version. When a user updates to version 1.3.5 or later, the system automatically checks if migrations need to run, executes them idempotently (safely running multiple times), and marks them complete. This ensures that all existing installations get automatically fixed without manual intervention.

This release includes the first migration: a section order fix that automatically reorders TODO.md files where "Deleted Tasks" appears before "Recently Completed". The system is designed to be simple for developers (just add a function and register it) while being transparent and safe for users (automatic, idempotent, with clear feedback). Comprehensive documentation has been added, including a developer guide for creating new migrations and updated release process documentation that explains how migrations integrate with the release workflow.
