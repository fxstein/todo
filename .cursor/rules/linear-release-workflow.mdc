# Automated Release Workflow

**Trigger:** "start release" or "release <version>" with Linear issue ID

## Workflow Steps

1. **Create ai-todo task structure:**
   - Root task: `[<AIT-ID>] Release <version>`
   - Subtasks: Generate summary → Prepare → Approval gate → Execute → Monitor → Finalize
   - Update Linear issue to "In Progress"

2. **Mark in progress:** Start root task and first subtask before beginning

3. **Generate summary:** `release/AI_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md` (2-3 paragraphs, user-facing changes)

4. **Prepare:** Run `./release/release.sh --prepare [--beta] --summary release/AI_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`

5. **Commit & push:** `git add release/ && git commit && git push`

6. **Update Linear:** Comment with summary link, request approval

7. **Monitor Linear for approval:**
   - Poll `user-linear.list_comments` every 60s
   - Keywords: "Approve", "Proceed", "Execute" = continue | "Abort" = stop
   - If feedback about the document or version number is provided, make the changes as necessary and edit the release summary then go back to Commit & push and update linear with the latest changes and monitor linear again for approval
   - Complete approval subtask when approved

8. **Execute:** Run `./release/release.sh --execute`

9. **Monitor CI:** Poll `gh run list` until completion (30s intervals)

10. **Finalize:**
    - Complete all tasks
    - Comment on Linear with release summary (PyPI link, GitHub release, duration)
    - Update Linear issue to "Done"

## Safety Rules

- ✅ Mark subtask as in-progress when starting each step
- ✅ **WAIT and MONITOR** at approval gate until explicit Linear comment
- ✅ **STOP** on ANY error - report to Linear, wait for user
- ❌ Never skip approval step
- ❌ Never proceed if CI fails
- ❌ Never use `--no-verify`
