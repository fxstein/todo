# Linear Document & Task Workflows

**Extends:** `linear-ai-todo-integration.mdc`

## Document Review

**When:** New docs created for review (analysis, design)

**Actions:**
1. Push to remote: `git add [file] && git commit -m "docs: add [name] (task#nn)" && git push`
2. Post GitHub URL to Linear issue via `user-linear.create_comment`

✅ Auto-push docs immediately for linkable URLs
❌ Don't wait for manual sharing

## Task Completion

**When:** Task completed or user requests "wrap up"

**Action:** Post Cursor's natural completion summary to Linear via `user-linear.create_comment`

✅ Use the summary Cursor naturally creates
❌ Don't create custom format or verbose details

## Issue ID

Parse Linear ID from branch name: `fxstein/ait-12-feature` → `AIT-12`
Use `user-linear.list_issues` to get UUID for `create_comment`
