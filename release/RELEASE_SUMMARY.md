# todo.ai v2.5.0 Release Summary

This release brings powerful note management capabilities, enhanced bug reporting for AI agents, and critical bash compatibility fixes. The focus is on improving developer experience while maintaining code quality and shell compatibility.

**Note Management System ([3e09a60](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/3e09a60))** adds `delete-note` and `update-note` commands, completing the note lifecycle. Previously notes could only be added but never modified or removed. Both commands work at all nesting levels with confirmation prompts for safety. The implementation reuses existing logic for consistency and properly handles multi-line notes with correct indentation.

**AI-Friendly Bug Reporting ([6691864](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/6691864))** redesigns the bug reporting workflow to detect AI agents (CURSOR_AI, AI_AGENT env vars) and auto-submit after preview, eliminating friction while maintaining user control for humans. Reports now use GitHub callout blocks, structured markdown with tables and collapsible sections, and intelligent error categorization with auto-suggested labels. Rich context collection includes git status, TODO.md state, environment variables, and recent commands.

**Critical Bash Compatibility Fix ([62fff75](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/62fff75), [da00320](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/da00320))** resolves a fundamental incompatibility where bash couldn't read coordination config when yq/python-yaml were unavailable. The sed-based fallback used zsh's `${match[]}` instead of bash's `${BASH_REMATCH[]}`, causing silent failures and wrong task IDs. Solution uses conversion markers in zsh code with automatic sed transformation during bash generation—zero runtime overhead, zero code bloat, clean separation.

Additional fixes include deeply nested subtask support (issue#36, [06f6c14](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/06f6c14)) where `show` command failed for 3+ nesting levels, and multi-line note indentation ([b6a1221](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/b6a1221)) where only the first line received proper formatting. Documentation updates include GETTING_STARTED.md examples, bug reporting design docs, and strengthened cursor rules for note usage.
