This release implements a comprehensive migration of Cursor rules from the deprecated `.cursorrules` file to the modern `.cursor/rules/` directory structure, significantly improving the maintainability and organization of AI agent configuration.

The most significant improvement is the complete migration to the official Cursor rules format. The tool now creates individual `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` instead of a single `.cursorrules` file, providing better organization, version control, and scalability. Each rule is now in its own file with proper YAML front matter, making it easier to manage and update individual rules. The migration system automatically converts existing `.cursorrules` files on update, ensuring a smooth transition for all users.

Additionally, this release introduces intelligent path detection for cursor rules. The tool now automatically detects where `todo.ai` is installed (developer repo, global PATH, project-specific, etc.) and dynamically updates cursor rules with the correct paths. This eliminates hardcoded `./todo.ai` references that would fail in most installation scenarios, making the bug reporting and installation instructions work correctly regardless of where the tool is installed.

All documentation has been updated to reflect the new `.cursor/rules/` structure, and the release process now correctly identifies cursor rule changes as backend infrastructure updates.
