When the user says "Release todo.ai" or similar:

1. **Generate a human-readable release summary** by analyzing commits since the last release
   - Review the commit messages to understand the changes
   - Write a 2-3 paragraph summary highlighting the key improvements, new features, and important changes
   - Focus on user-facing benefits and notable improvements
   - Optionally include commit links: `([hash](https://github.com/user/repo/commit/fullhash))` when referencing specific commits
   - Get the repo URL: `git remote get-url origin` and convert SSH to HTTPS if needed
   - **Save to `release/RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`** - This is the ONLY source of truth for release notes

2. **Prepare release (default):** `./release/release.sh --prepare --summary release/RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`
   - Analyzes commits since last release
   - Determines version bump type (major/minor/patch) based on commit messages
   - Generates preview from RELEASE_SUMMARY.md
   - Saves state for execution
   - **You can edit RELEASE_SUMMARY.md after this step** - changes will be included in release

3. **Execute release:** Run the command shown by prepare step: `./release/release.sh --execute`
   - Regenerates release notes from current RELEASE_SUMMARY.md (ensuring latest edits are included)
   - Updates version in todo.ai
   - Commits, tags, and pushes to GitHub
   - Creates GitHub release with regenerated notes
   - No prompts or manual input required

**CRITICAL:** `release/RELEASE_SUMMARY.md` is the single source of truth - any edits before execute are automatically included.
