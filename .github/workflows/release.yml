name: Release

# This workflow is integrated with release/release.sh:
# 1. release.sh creates the tag, commits version changes, and creates GitHub release with shell assets
# 2. This workflow (triggered by tag push) builds Python package, publishes to PyPI, and attaches dist files
# The release.sh script creates the release first, so this workflow attaches files to the existing release
