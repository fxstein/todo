This release introduces significant improvements to task lifecycle management and developer workflows. The new empty trash functionality automatically removes tasks from the Deleted section after 30 days, providing a clean safety net for accidentally deleted items while preventing TODO.md from growing indefinitely. Users no longer need to manually clean up deleted tasks, as the system now handles this transparently on startup.

The prune command offers powerful control over archived task retention with flexible filtering options. Users can remove archived tasks based on age thresholds, specific task ranges, or individual task IDs. The command includes robust safety features such as automatic backups before pruning, git history analysis to determine archive dates, and preservation of task metadata for audit trails. Comprehensive usage examples are available in [docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md).

For contributors, this release adds a new [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide that outlines project standards and best practices. The branch-cleanup skill helps developers maintain clean local repositories by identifying and safely deleting branches with merged pull requests. Additionally, ascii-guard linting has been integrated into the development workflow to ensure all documentation remains clean and properly formatted.

Several bug fixes improve robustness including proper timezone handling in date comparisons, correct task ID sorting in archive backups, and Windows UTF-8 encoding support. These improvements enhance reliability across different platforms and edge cases.
