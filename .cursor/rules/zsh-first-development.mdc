**CRITICAL: NEVER edit `todo.bash` directly**

- `todo.bash` is auto-generated during releases
- All development MUST be done in `todo.ai` (zsh version)
- Bash conversion is automated in `release/release.sh`
- Manual edits to `todo.bash` will be overwritten

**If todo.bash needs changes:**
1. Make the change in `todo.ai`
2. Release script will convert it automatically
3. Both versions are tested before release

See `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` for complete workflow.
