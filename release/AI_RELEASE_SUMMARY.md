This beta release focuses on workflow improvements and agent-facing enhancements. The release process has been refactored into a Cursor Skill (see [release-workflow/SKILL.md](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/.cursor/skills/release-workflow/SKILL.md)), providing better guidance for AI agents preparing releases with integrated Linear issue tracking. The new skill-based approach simplifies the release workflow while maintaining all safety checks, pre-flight validation, and approval gates.

Task management receives significant improvements with two new commands: `empty-trash` automatically removes deleted tasks after 30 days, and `prune` provides flexible cleanup of archived tasks with multiple filtering options (age, task ranges, or archive ranges). Both commands include comprehensive backup mechanisms to preserve task metadata and enable recovery if needed. Complete documentation is available in the [guides](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/tree/main/docs/guides) and [examples](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md) directories.

Linear integration continues to mature with refined workflow rules, improved branch naming conventions (always using userid prefix), and better document review processes. Several bug fixes improve robustness including timezone-aware datetime comparisons in prune operations, regex metacharacter escaping for task IDs, duplicate prevention in subtask operations, and Python 3.10 compatibility improvements. This release includes comprehensive test coverage for all new features.
