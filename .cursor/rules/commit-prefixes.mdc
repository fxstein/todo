When making commits, use explicit prefixes to help the release script correctly determine version bumps:

**Backend/Infrastructure Commits (will be PATCH releases):**
- `backend:` - Backend infrastructure changes (e.g., `backend: Fix release script error handling`)
- `infra:` - Infrastructure improvements (e.g., `infra: Add release logging`)
- `release:` - Release process improvements (e.g., `release: Add commit link support`)
- `internal:` - Internal refactoring (e.g., `internal: Refactor version update function`)

**Frontend/User-Facing Commits (can be MINOR/MAJOR):**
- `feat:` - New features for users (e.g., `feat: Add task filtering command`)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes that affect users (e.g., `fix: Correct task modification logic`)
- `docs:` - User-facing documentation (e.g., `docs: Update README with examples`)

**Special Cases:**
- Backend-only releases (only infrastructure changes) are automatically detected as PATCH
- If you forget a prefix, file analysis will catch backend-only changes
- Mixed releases (both frontend and backend) use keyword analysis
