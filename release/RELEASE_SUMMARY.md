# Release Summary

This release includes several improvements focused on usability and developer workflow enhancements.

The main feature addition is the enhancement of the `--info` command output, which now displays the configuration file location. This makes it easier for users to locate and understand where todo.ai stores its configuration, especially helpful when working with multiple projects or troubleshooting setup issues. The config file location is shown at the end of the `--info` output for quick reference.

Additionally, this release includes documentation improvements that streamline the user experience. The README has been refined with a more concise examples section, reducing from 13 examples to just 5 carefully selected ones that cover the most common use cases while adding a touch of humor. The bug review workflow Cursor rule has also been updated to use zsh syntax (matching the tool's actual implementation) and includes comprehensive guidance on closing bug issues with proper release references.

**Key improvements:**
- Added config file location to `--info` output for better visibility
- Streamlined README examples (5 essential examples instead of 13)
- Updated bug-review-workflow Cursor rule with zsh syntax and issue closing guidance
