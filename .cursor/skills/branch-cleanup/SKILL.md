# Branch Cleanup

Automated workflow to sync main with origin and clean up local branches that have merged PRs.

## Quick Start

When user asks to "clean up branches" or "delete merged branches":

1. **Pre-flight checks:**
   - `git fetch origin` (update remote refs)
   - `git branch --show-current` (verify current branch)
   - If not on main: **Ask user:** "Should I switch to main? (Current: {branch})"

2. **Sync main:**
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git pull origin main --ff-only`
   - **If conflicts:** ⚠️ Stop and report "Main has conflicts. Resolve manually."

3. **List local branches:**
   - `git branch --format='%(refname:short)'`
   - Filter out: `main`, `master`, `develop`, `staging`, `production`
   - **If no branches:** Report "No local branches to clean up" and STOP.

4. **Check PR status for each branch:**
   - Get PR for branch: `gh pr list --head {branch} --state merged --json number,title,url`
   - **If merged PR found:** Add to cleanup list
   - **If no PR or not merged:** Skip

5. **Present cleanup list:**
   - Show table with: branch name, PR number, PR title, PR URL
   - **Ask user:** "Delete these {count} branches? (y/n)"
   - **If user declines:** STOP.

6. **Delete branches:**
   - For each approved branch:
     - `git branch -d {branch}` (safe delete)
     - **If fails with unmerged warning:** Show warning and skip
     - **If succeeds:** Report "✅ Deleted {branch}"
   - **Final summary:** "Deleted {count} branches, skipped {count} unmerged branches"

## Workflow Details

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# Fetch latest remote refs
git fetch origin

# Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**If not on main:**
- Show: "Currently on `{CURRENT_BRANCH}`. Switch to main?"
- Wait for user confirmation

**Safety:**
- Never switch branches with uncommitted changes
- Check: `git status --porcelain` (must be empty)

### Step 2: Sync Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Fast-forward merge only (no conflicts)
git pull origin main --ff-only
```

**If fast-forward fails:**
- ⚠️ Stop with error: "Main branch has diverged from origin. Manual resolution required."
- Do NOT attempt merge or rebase

### Step 3: Identify Merged Branches

For each local branch:

```bash
# Get merged PR for branch
gh pr list --head {branch} --state merged --json number,title,url --limit 1
```

**Branch categories:**

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Merged PR found | Add to cleanup list |
| Open PR found | Skip (not merged) |
| No PR found | Skip (might be local work) |
| Protected branch | Skip (main, master, etc.) |

**Protected branches:**
- `main`, `master`, `develop`, `staging`, `production`
- Any branch matching `origin/*`

### Step 4: Present Cleanup List

Format as markdown table:

```markdown
## Branches with merged PRs

| Branch | PR | Title |
|--------|-----|-------|
| fxstein/AIT-12-feature | [#45](url) | Feature implementation |
| oliver/ait-8-bugfix | [#38](url) | Fix login bug |

Total: 2 branches
```

**User prompt:**
"Delete these branches? They have merged PRs and are safe to remove. (y/n)"

### Step 5: Safe Deletion

```bash
# Safe delete (only if fully merged)
git branch -d {branch}
```

**If `git branch -d` fails:**
- Shows: "The branch '{branch}' is not fully merged."
- **Action:** Skip and report to user
- **Reason:** Prevents data loss

**Force delete (`-D`) is NEVER used automatically.**

## Edge Cases

### No Merged Branches

If no branches qualify for cleanup:
```
✅ All local branches are up to date.
No merged branches found for cleanup.
```

### Partially Merged Branches

If branch has commits not in main but PR is merged:
- `git branch -d` will fail (expected)
- Report: "⚠️ Skipped {branch}: has unmerged commits (possible rebase)"
- User can manually verify with: `git log main..{branch}`

### Remote Tracking Branches

Only delete **local** branches, never remote refs:
- ✅ Delete: `fxstein/AIT-12-feature`
- ❌ Skip: `origin/fxstein/AIT-12-feature`

Use `git push origin --delete {branch}` only if user explicitly requests remote deletion.

## Error Handling

**If ANY error occurs:**
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Report the specific error
3. Show current state: branch name, operation attempted
4. WAIT for user input

**Common errors:**

| Error | Cause | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "Not on main" | Current branch not main | Ask to switch |
| "Fast-forward failed" | Main diverged from origin | Stop, manual resolution |
| "gh command not found" | GitHub CLI not installed | Stop, ask user to install |
| "Branch not fully merged" | Branch has unmerged commits | Skip branch |

## Safety Guarantees

- ✅ Never force-delete (`-D`) branches
- ✅ Never delete without user confirmation
- ✅ Never modify remote branches
- ✅ Never switch branches with uncommitted changes
- ✅ Always use `--ff-only` for main sync

## Output Format

### Success

```
🔄 Syncing main with origin...
✅ Main is up to date

📋 Found 3 branches with merged PRs:
- fxstein/AIT-12-feature (PR #45)
- oliver/ait-8-bugfix (PR #38)
- fxstein/AIT-10-docs (PR #42)

🗑️  Deleting branches...
✅ Deleted fxstein/AIT-12-feature
✅ Deleted oliver/ait-8-bugfix
✅ Deleted fxstein/AIT-10-docs

✨ Cleanup complete: 3 branches deleted
```

### With Skipped Branches

```
🗑️  Deleting branches...
✅ Deleted fxstein/AIT-12-feature
⚠️  Skipped fxstein/AIT-15-wip: not fully merged
✅ Deleted oliver/ait-8-bugfix

✨ Cleanup complete: 2 deleted, 1 skipped
```

## Additional Features

### Dry Run Mode

If user asks for "preview" or "dry run":
- Execute steps 1-4 only
- Show cleanup list
- STOP before deletion

### Delete Remote Branches

If user explicitly asks to "delete remote branches too":
- After local deletion succeeds
- For each deleted branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete {branch}
  ```
- Report: "✅ Deleted {branch} (local + remote)"

## Requirements

- **Git:** Version 2.0+
- **GitHub CLI (gh):** Required for PR status checks
- **Repository:** Must be a git repository with GitHub remote

## Forbidden Actions

- ❌ Never use `git branch -D` (force delete)
- ❌ Never delete branches without user confirmation
- ❌ Never modify `main`, `master`, or protected branches
- ❌ Never attempt merge/rebase to resolve conflicts
