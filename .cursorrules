## Task Management
It is required to track tasks and subtasks using todo.ai and not via built in TODO tools
TODO.md and .todo.ai/ must always be committed together
Always ask for user confirmation before archiving completed tasks using todo.ai

## Installation
When installing todo.ai from https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai, use curl to download the single file: `curl -o todo.ai https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxstein/todo.ai/main/todo.ai && chmod +x todo.ai`. Do NOT clone the repository with git clone - only the single todo.ai file is needed.

## Releases
When the user says "Release todo.ai" or similar, run the intelligent release script: `./release.sh`
The script will:
1. Automatically analyze commits since the last release
2. Determine version bump type (major/minor/patch) based on commit messages
3. Generate release notes from commits
4. Ask for human review if it's a major release or has many commits (>10)
5. Execute the release automatically after approval

If the user requests a release review, show them the generated release notes and wait for approval before proceeding. For major releases or releases with >10 commits, always request human review before executing.
