This beta release brings significant improvements to task workflow management and cross-version compatibility. The headline feature is the new `start` and `stop` commands, which allow you to mark tasks as in-progress and track active work across sessions. When you start a task, it automatically gets tagged with `#inprogress`, and AI agents using the MCP server can now see which tasks are actively being worked on through a dedicated status prompt. This makes it easier to maintain context across multiple coding sessions and prevents duplicate work on the same tasks.

The Python CLI has been upgraded to support Python 3.14 while maintaining full backward compatibility with Python 3.10 through 3.13, ensuring the tool works across a wide range of environments. We've also fixed several important bugs that improve reliability: the `restore` command now correctly restores subtasks in the proper order and preserves their completion status, the `--root` parameter now works correctly in the Python CLI (it was previously being ignored), and test isolation has been significantly improved to prevent cross-test contamination.

Behind the scenes, we've enhanced the development infrastructure with integrated `todo-ai lint` checks in pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent TODO.md formatting across all contributions. The test suite now includes comprehensive parity validation between the shell script and Python CLI, with better environment isolation and more robust path resolution. These improvements make todo.ai more reliable and maintainable for both users and contributors.
