# Cursor Rules Guidelines

Keep rules **short, precise, and specific** (under ~30 lines).

**Requirements:**
- Focus on what agents MUST do or MUST NOT do
- Use ✅/❌ examples for correct vs incorrect behavior
- Reference docs instead of duplicating content

**Before committing:** Can this rule be shorter? Is every line essential?

**NEVER** create verbose rules with lengthy checklists or detailed explanations.
