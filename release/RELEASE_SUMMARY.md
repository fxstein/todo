This release fixes a potential timing issue in the release script that could cause tags to be created without proper verification. The enhancement adds explicit commit hash tracking and multiple verification checks to ensure tags always point to commits with the correct version number.

The fix includes pre-tag verification (checking the commit contains the correct version before tagging) and post-tag verification (confirming the tag points to the correct version). Additionally, tags now explicitly reference specific commit hashes instead of relying on HEAD, which prevents race conditions that could occur during the release process. This ensures that releases are always created correctly and helps prevent issues where users might download a release that appears to have an incorrect version number due to timing or caching issues.
