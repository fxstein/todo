This beta release introduces two significant new features for managing archived tasks: the `empty_trash` command and the `prune_archive` command, along with comprehensive Linear workflow integration for development teams.

The `empty_trash` command provides automatic cleanup of old archived tasks, with a configurable 30-day retention period by default. Tasks are only permanently deleted after spending 30 days in the archive, giving users ample time to recover accidentally archived items. The command includes dry-run support and creates backups before any deletions. The `prune_archive` command complements this by offering fine-grained control over archive cleanup, with filters for task age, completion status, section membership, and specific task ID ranges. Both commands include comprehensive test coverage and detailed documentation.

Linear workflow integration has been significantly enhanced with new Cursor rules for the kickoff workflow (branch creation, ai-todo planning, status updates), document review workflow (automatic GitHub URL posting), task completion workflow (summary posting), and issue investigation workflow. These improvements streamline development coordination between high-level strategy (Linear) and low-level execution (ai-todo), making it easier for teams to track work from planning through completion. Additionally, the release workflow has been refactored into a dedicated Cursor Skill with improved documentation and error handling, making releases more reliable and easier to execute.
