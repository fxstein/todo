When creating functionality that requires installation or migration steps, **MUST** integrate them into the automated systems:

**Installation Steps (files, Cursor rules, config):**
- Integrate into `init_cursor_rules()` function
- Update `README.md` if user-visible

**Migration Steps (fixes existing installs, format changes):**
- Add to `MIGRATIONS` array: `"VERSION|ID|DESCRIPTION|FUNCTION_NAME"`
- Create migration function following pattern in `docs/development/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- Test idempotency and verify version matches release

**Cursor Rules (new agent instructions):**
- Add to `init_cursor_rules()` with `todo.ai-` prefix for end-user rules
- Use dynamic path detection (`get_todo_ai_path_for_rules()`)
- Add to migration `section_mappings` if migrating from `.cursorrules`

**Update Process:**
- Migrations and cursor rules run automatically on update (already integrated)

**NEVER** create features requiring manual installation/migration steps without integrating into the appropriate system.
