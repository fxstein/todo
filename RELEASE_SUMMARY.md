This release adds GitHub commit links to release notes and summaries, making it easier for users to explore the specific changes behind each feature and fix.

The most significant improvement is that all commits in release notes now automatically include clickable GitHub links ([b88d04f](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/b88d04f37b8743da2a6234802726eb8131cbcfd8)). Each commit entry now displays as "Commit message ([short-hash](link))", allowing users to click through and see the full commit details, file changes, and context. This transforms the release notes from a static list into an interactive changelog that encourages exploration of the codebase.

Additionally, the release process documentation ([1d359a2](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/1d359a25b45d61b85c730e10137bb8c6f7f90dbf)) now includes examples showing how AI agents can include commit links in summaries, making it easier to reference specific changes in the human-readable summary section. The cursor rules have also been updated to guide agents on how to generate these links when creating summaries.
