When the user says "Release todo.ai" or similar:

1. **Generate a human-readable release summary** by analyzing commits since the last release
   - Review the commit messages to understand the changes
   - Write a 2-3 paragraph summary highlighting the key improvements, new features, and important changes
   - Focus on user-facing benefits and notable improvements
   - Optionally include commit links: `([hash](https://github.com/user/repo/commit/fullhash))` when referencing specific commits
   - Get the repo URL: `git remote get-url origin` and convert SSH to HTTPS if needed
   - Save the summary to `release/RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`

2. **Run the intelligent release script** with the summary: `./release/release.sh --summary release/RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`
   - The script will automatically analyze commits since the last release
   - Determine version bump type (major/minor/patch) based on commit messages
   - Generate detailed release notes from commits
   - Include the AI-generated summary at the top of the release notes
   - Ask for human review if it's a major release or has many commits (>10)
   - Execute the release automatically after approval

If the user requests a release review, show them the generated release notes and summary, then wait for approval before proceeding. For major releases or releases with >10 commits, always request human review before executing.
