This release implements intelligent backend-only release detection to ensure version numbers accurately reflect user impact, not just infrastructure improvements.

The most significant improvement is the implementation of a hybrid approach for release numbering that distinguishes between user-facing features and backend infrastructure changes ([1d1a264](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/1d1a264...)). The release script now automatically detects when only backend files (like `release.sh`, `.cursorrules`, or developer documentation) have changed and correctly classifies these as PATCH releases rather than MINOR releases. This aligns with semantic versioning principles where version numbers should reflect actual user impact, not internal infrastructure work.

Additionally, comprehensive analysis and documentation ([a9287d9](https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai/commit/a9287d9...)) were created to review all previous releases and establish clear guidelines. The system now supports explicit commit message prefixes (`backend:`, `infra:`, `release:`, `internal:`) as the fastest detection method, with automatic file analysis as a fallback to catch forgotten prefixes. This ensures that backend-only releases like previous versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 would now be correctly classified as patch releases (1.1.1 and 1.1.2), making version numbers more meaningful for users.
