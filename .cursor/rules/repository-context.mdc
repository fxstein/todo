This is the development repository for todo.ai itself. We are developing the tool here, NOT installing it.

**Important Rules:**
- Do NOT run installation commands (curl, download) - the tool is already present in this repo
- The `todo.ai` file in this directory IS the tool being developed
- Avoid circular references: don't try to install/update todo.ai when already in the todo.ai repo
- This repository contains the source code, documentation, and development tools for todo.ai

**When working in this repository:**
- You are working ON the tool, not WITH the tool
- The `todo.ai` script in the root directory is the active development version
- Changes here will be released to end users via GitHub releases
- Follow the commit prefix guidelines in `commit-prefixes.mdc` for proper release numbering
