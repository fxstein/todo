## ai-todo v3.0.0 Release Summary

**ai-todo v3.0.0** represents a complete rewrite of the project, evolving from a shell-based task management tool into a modern, production-ready Python package. The MCP server and CLI are now unified into a single executable (`ai-todo`), providing seamless integration with AI assistants like Cursor while maintaining a powerful command-line interface. Installation is as simple as `pip install ai-todo` or `uv tool install ai-todo`, and the package is published via PyPI with secure OIDC-based trusted publishing.

This major release introduces several key features for data integrity and workflow safety. A **tamper detection system** protects TODO.md from unintended external modifications, with configurable security modes and automatic recovery options. An **archive cooldown** (60-second default) prevents AI agents from prematurely archiving completed tasks, requiring human review for root tasks. The new **start/stop commands** allow marking tasks as in-progress with `#inprogress` tags. The **delete command** now removes subtasks by default, and deleted tasks display with `[D]` markers instead of confusing checkmarks.

The architecture has been significantly modernized. The Python implementation uses **FastMCP** for the MCP server with full async support. The CLI uses **Click** with rich help text. A comprehensive **CI/CD pipeline** on GitHub Actions handles testing across Python 3.13+ on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, with automated PyPI publishing on tagged releases. The data directory migrated from `.todo.ai/` to `.ai-todo/` with automatic migration for existing users. Legacy shell scripts remain available but are deprecated. The MCP/CLI tool set was audited and streamlined from 37 to 27 tools, removing redundant operations and standardizing naming conventions.
