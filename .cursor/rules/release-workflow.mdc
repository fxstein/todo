# Release Workflow

## Prepare a Release

When user asks to "prepare release" or "prepare beta release":

1. Wait for CI: `./scripts/wait-for-ci.sh`
2. Generate 2-3 paragraphs highlighting user-facing changes. Save to `release/AI_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`.
   - **For beta-to-beta releases**: Analyze commits since the last beta tag.
   - **For stable releases (graduating from beta)**: Analyze ALL commits since the last **stable** release (not the last beta). This ensures the summary covers the entire beta cycle.
3. Run: `./release/release.sh --prepare [--beta] --summary release/AI_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`
4. **STOP.** Show preview and let user review before proceeding.

## Execute a Release

When user asks to "execute release":

1. Run: `./release/release.sh --execute`
2. Monitor GitHub Actions until success.

## Error Handling

**If ANY error occurs:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**
2. Report the error.
3. **WAIT FOR USER.** Do not attempt auto-recovery.

## Forbidden Actions

- ❌ Never auto-execute after prepare.
- ❌ Never bypass CI/CD failures.
- ❌ **NEVER use `--no-verify` on git commits.**
