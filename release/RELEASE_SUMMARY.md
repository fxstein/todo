This release completes the Cursor rules migration system with an important cleanup enhancement. When users update todo.ai, the migration process now automatically cleans up the old `.cursorrules` file by removing all todo.ai-specific sections and paragraphs, ensuring a clean transition to the new `.cursor/rules/` directory structure.

The cleanup process is safe and reversible: before making any changes, a timestamped backup is created (`.cursorrules.backup.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`), allowing users to restore their original file if needed. The cleanup intelligently preserves any user-specific custom content that doesn't reference todo.ai, while removing all migrated sections. If the file becomes empty after cleanup, it's removed entirely to keep repositories clean.

This enhancement ensures that users don't have duplicate todo.ai rules in both the old `.cursorrules` file and the new `.cursor/rules/` directory, preventing confusion and ensuring consistent behavior. The migration is now a complete, hands-off experience that handles both the migration to the new format and the cleanup of the old format automatically.
