This release introduces two powerful new commands for managing task lifecycle: prune and empty-trash. The prune command (task#267) allows users to permanently remove archived tasks from TODO.md with fine-grained control over retention periods using `--days`, or by targeting specific task ranges with `--from-task` and `--to-task` options. All pruned tasks are automatically backed up to timestamped archive files in the `.ai-todo/archives/` directory, preserving full task metadata and enabling recovery if needed. Comprehensive documentation and examples are available in [docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md).

The empty-trash command (task#268) complements the prune functionality by automatically removing deleted tasks that are older than 30 days on startup, helping keep your TODO.md clean without manual intervention. This automatic cleanup runs quietly in the background and includes comprehensive test coverage to ensure data safety. Users can also manually trigger empty-trash operations when needed.

Several critical bug fixes improve system reliability across different Python versions and edge cases. Python 3.10 compatibility has been restored by replacing `datetime.UTC` with `timezone.utc` throughout the codebase. Timezone-aware datetime comparisons in prune operations now work correctly across different system configurations. Regex metacharacter escaping for task IDs prevents errors when working with tasks that contain special characters, and duplicate prevention in subtask operations ensures data integrity during complex task manipulations.
