# ai-todo Interaction Rules

## Critical Requirements

1. **USE MCP SERVER** (`project-0-todo.ai-todo-ai`) for ALL task management. Never use built-in TODO tools.
2. **NEVER edit TODO.md directly.** File is protected by tamper detection.
3. **ASK before completing** a root task (subtasks can be completed freely).
4. **ASK before archiving** any task or task list.
5. **START tasks** before working on them using `start_task` to mark as `#inprogress`.

## Workflow

- Start the root task AND current subtask when beginning work
- Complete subtasks as you finish them (no approval needed)
- Ask user before completing the parent/root task
- Ask user before archiving completed tasks

## Tamper Detection

If you trigger a `TamperError`:

1. **STOP.** Do not bypass the error.
2. **INFORM** the user that TODO.md was modified externally.
3. **WAIT** for user approval before using `accept_tamper(reason)`.
