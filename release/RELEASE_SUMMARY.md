This release fixes a critical bug that left orphaned subtasks when deleting parent tasks. Previously, when a user deleted a parent task, its subtasks would remain in the document, creating orphaned references and breaking the task hierarchy structure. This bug was discovered during testing of version 1.3.4 and has been resolved in this release.

The fix automatically includes all subtasks (both direct and nested) when deleting a parent task, ensuring the document structure remains intact. When deleting a subtask directly, only that specific subtask is removed, preserving the parent task and sibling subtasks. This maintains data integrity and prevents the accumulation of orphaned task references that could confuse users and clutter the task list.

The implementation intelligently detects parent tasks (tasks without dots in their ID) and automatically finds all associated subtasks, including deeply nested ones. This fix ensures that task deletion behavior is intuitive and maintains proper hierarchical relationships throughout the document lifecycle.
