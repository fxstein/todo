# ai-todo v3.0.0 Release Summary

**ai-todo v3.0.0** marks the completion of a comprehensive Python rewrite, transforming the project from a shell-based tool into a modern, production-ready Python package. The MCP server and CLI are now unified into a single executable (`ai-todo`), providing seamless integration with AI assistants like Cursor while maintaining a powerful command-line interface. Installation is as simple as `pip install ai-todo` or `uv tool install ai-todo`.

This release introduces several key features for data integrity and workflow safety. A **tamper detection system** now protects TODO.md from unintended external modifications, with configurable security modes and automatic recovery options. An **archive cooldown** (60-second default) prevents AI agents from prematurely archiving completed tasks, requiring human review for root tasks. The **delete command** now removes subtasks by default, fixing orphaned subtask issues that plagued earlier versions.

The internal architecture has been significantly streamlined. The MCP/CLI tool set was audited and reduced from 37 to 27 tools, removing redundant operations (update, uninstall, rollback, report_bug) and standardizing naming conventions. The data directory migrated from `.todo.ai/` to `.ai-todo/` for better discoverability, with automatic migration for existing users. The Cursor rules system was consolidated from a monolithic `.cursorrules` file to modular `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` documents, and legacy shell scripts are now deprecated in favor of the Python implementation.
