This beta release focuses on hardening the CI/CD pipeline and improving the user experience for task notes. Key improvements include fixes for silent CI/CD failures, optimized workflow triggers for documentation-only changes, and enhanced release process reliability with orphan tag cleanup.

User-facing changes include the removal of confirmation prompts for `update-note` and `delete-note` commands to streamline workflow, and a fix for preserving checkbox states when modifying tasks.
