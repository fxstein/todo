This release introduces significant workflow improvements and two major new features for task management. The release workflow has been completely refactored into a modular Cursor Skill with Linear integration, enabling automated issue tracking, pre-flight validation, and comprehensive release notes generation. This modernization improves release reliability and provides better visibility into the development process.

The prune functionality (task#267) is now available, allowing users to permanently remove archived tasks from TODO.md with fine-grained control. Users can specify retention periods with `--days` or target specific task ranges, and all pruned tasks are automatically backed up to timestamped archive files. The empty trash feature (task#268) complements this by automatically removing deleted tasks older than 30 days on startup, with comprehensive test coverage ensuring data safety. Both features include extensive documentation in [docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/docs/examples/PRUNE_EXAMPLES.md).

Linear integration has been significantly enhanced with new Cursor rules that automate issue tracking workflows. The system now supports automated branch creation, task planning, PR workflows, and issue state management. Documentation includes [linear-ai-todo-integration.mdc](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/.cursor/rules/linear-ai-todo-integration.mdc) and [linear-document-workflow.mdc](https://github.com/fxstein/ai-todo/blob/main/.cursor/rules/linear-document-workflow.mdc) for comprehensive guidance.

Several critical bug fixes improve system reliability, including timezone-aware date comparisons, duplicate task prevention, regex metacharacter escaping, and Python 3.10 compatibility fixes. The release also includes architectural improvements such as removing orphaned bash references and standardizing branch naming conventions.
