# todo.ai v2.7.2 - Bug Fixes and Reliability Improvements

This release includes two important bug fixes that improve reliability and fix edge cases in task management. The first fix resolves an issue where the `modify` command could silently fail on tasks without bold formatting, making them unfindable by subsequent commands like `note`. This occurred when tasks existed in non-bold format (`#task_id`) but the modify command's sed replacement only matched bold format (`**#task_id**`). The fix updates all task-related functions to handle both bold and non-bold formats, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of how tasks are formatted.

The second fix addresses a migration path error that occurred when todo.ai was installed to system directories like `/usr/local/bin`. When running the update command, the script would change to the script's directory before executing migrations, causing the migration system to look for `.todo.ai` in the wrong location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/.todo.ai` instead of the user's working directory). The fix captures the original working directory at script startup and uses it consistently for migrations, ensuring they always run in the correct location where the user's `.todo.ai` directory exists.

Additionally, this release includes improvements to the migration system's error handling, replacing glob expansion with `find` commands to prevent "no matches found" errors when migration directories exist but contain no migration files. These changes improve the overall robustness of the tool, especially for users with system-wide installations or when working from different directories.
