This beta release contains the actual fix for the CI/CD release job skipping issue. After extensive investigation and multiple test releases, the root cause was finally identified: debug logging steps were referencing `needs.changes` dependencies that weren't listed in the job's needs array, causing GitHub Actions to skip the entire job as invalid configuration.

The solution removes all references to dependencies not in the needs array and matches the proven v3.0.0b7 configuration exactly. Both validate-release and release jobs now use direct GitHub context (`startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')`) for tag detection, with simplified debug logging that only references valid dependencies. This eliminates the configuration error that was causing GitHub Actions to reject the jobs at orchestration time.

This release maintains comprehensive debug logging at critical workflow checkpoints while ensuring all dependency references are valid, restoring reliable release execution with clear diagnostic visibility for future troubleshooting.
